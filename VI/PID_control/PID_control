This VI contains a logical program based on  temperature controlling using PID Algorithm.
This Algorithm make the heating-cooling process more time efficient for the whole system to complete the process.
Here we have to insert variables like
1)Gain
2)Reset
3)Rate
4)Manual Output(20 - 30)
5)heater power(low/med/high) 
6)Setpoint (To be achieve)
Set PID control to manual setting then set above variables accordingly.
