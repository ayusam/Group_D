Sequencial Working:

GUI:
1. Selecting the device.
2. Setting voltage value.
3. setting the reading number and waiting between them.

Output:
1. Initialise the system followed by by zero check(Ready to use).
2. taking reading at defined waiting time both current and voltage(for precision of output).
3. Averaging both the array of values.
4. calculate resistance using Ohm's Law.
